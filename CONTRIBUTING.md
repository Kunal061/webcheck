## Code Standards

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Define proper types and interfaces
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Export types for reusability

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Add 'use client' directive for client components
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Use descriptive prop names

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow responsive design principles
- Maintain consistent spacing and colors
- Use semantic color names

### Code Formatting
- Follow existing code style
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

## Making Changes

### Before You Start
1. Check existing issues and PRs
2. Create an issue to discuss major changes
3. Get feedback before implementing

### Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes:
   - Write clean, documented code
   - Follow existing patterns
   - Test thoroughly

3. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```

4. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. Create a Pull Request

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits:
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test additions/changes
- `chore:` Build/tooling changes

Examples:
```
feat: add PDF export functionality
fix: resolve broken link detection issue
docs: update installation instructions
```

## Adding New Analysis Features

To add a new analysis category:

1. Update the analysis interface in `types/index.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export interface AnalysisResult {
     // ... existing fields
     yourNewAnalysis: YourNewAnalysisType;
   }
   ```

2. Add analysis logic in `app/api/analyze/route.ts`:
   ```typescript
   function analyzeYourFeature($: CheerioAPI): YourNewAnalysisType {
     // Your analysis logic
   }
   ```

3. Update the result object to include your analysis

4. Create a display component in `app/components/ReportCard.tsx`

5. Add documentation in README.md

## Documentation

When adding features:
- Update README.md
- Update SUMMARY.md if technical
- Add inline code comments
- Update TypeScript types

## Performance Guidelines

- Keep bundle size minimal
- Optimize images and assets
- Use lazy loading when appropriate
- Minimize API calls
- Set appropriate timeouts
- Cache when beneficial
